            This week in enineering, I worked on getting my website up and running. I worked on this for a couple days with classmates and the techer. In additon, the class and I got told that we had an up coimg test, so that day we talked about the what was going to be on the test, what to study for, and what to expect in the test. Also, on wednesday my class and I learned about safty in the class room, and the steps to makeimg a new invention or upgrading one. On thrusady, half of my classmates and I did a chaleng where we had to work as a team to get a marbel into a cup using a cut in-half pipes to trave the marbel into the cup. My team did get the marbel into the cup, so out teacher mad it more of a chaleng and gav us two marbel, we also completed that chaleng, in the end my team won. over this weekend I will problly stay home most of the time, work on hme work, and play with my pets.
